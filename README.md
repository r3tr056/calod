**CALOD** is an ultra-fast caching solution designed to handle a lot of data
with ultra-low latency network calls. With its predictive cache invalidation,
CALOD ensures that your applications can retrieve data quickly and efficiently,
enhancing performance and user experience.

## Features

- **Ultra-Low Latency**: Experience minimal delays in data retrieval, making
  your applications faster and more responsive.
- **Fast Caching**: Store and access data rapidly to improve the overall
  efficiency of your applications.
- **Predictive Cache Invalidation**: Intelligently manage cache entries to
  ensure your data is always fresh and relevant.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **C Compiler**: Ensure you have a C compiler like `gcc` installed on your
  machine.
- **Make**: Make sure you have `make` installed for building the project.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/r3tr056/CALOD.git
   cd CALOD
   ```

2. **Build CALOD:**

   ```bash
   make
   ```

3. **Configure CALOD**: Create a configuration file (e.g., `calod-config.json`)
   with your desired settings. Below is a sample configuration:

   ```json
   {
       "port": 8995,
       "maxSize": 1000,
       "predictiveInvalidation": true,
       "ttl": 3600
   }
   ```

4. **Start CALOD server:**

   ```bash
   ./calod
   ```

   By default, CALOD runs on port **8995**. You can change the port in the
   configuration file.

5. **Access the CALOD API**: You can interact with CALOD via its REST API. By
   default, it runs on `http://localhost:8995`.

## Usage

### Basic Caching Example

You can interact with CALOD using HTTP requests. Below is an example using
`curl`:

- **Set a cache item:**

  ```bash
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8995/set \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d '{"key": "key1", "value": "value1", "ttl": 600}'
  ```

- **Get a cache item:**

  ```bash
  curl -X GET http://localhost:8995/get/key1
  ```

- **Invalidate a cache item:**

  ```bash
  curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8995/invalidate/key1
  ```

### Advanced Configuration

Configure CALOD according to your needs by adjusting options in
`calod-config.json`:

```json
{
    "maxSize": 1000, // Maximum number of items in the cache
    "predictiveInvalidation": true, // Enable predictive cache invalidation
    "ttl": 3600 // Default time-to-live for cache items in seconds
}
```

## Steps of Implemention a Hybrid Cache Eviction Strategy
We can adopt a hybrid eviction strategy that combines Least Recently Used (LRU) and Least Frequently Used (LFU) eviction algorithms. Additionally, we will introduce Predictive Eviction to remove entries before they are expected to be accessed based on patterns observed in their access history.

The strategy works in three parts:

- LRU handles entries that are not frequently accessed but are accessed recently.
- LFU retains entries that are accessed repeatedly, even if they aren't accessed recently.
- Predictive Eviction uses a machine learning-inspired heuristic to predict when certain keys will be accessed and keep them in the cache longer.

2. Data Structure Design: We'll need a combination of
- HashMap: for constant-time data access (O(1)) time complexity
- Linked Hash Map or Priority Queue for maintining the LRU and LFU aspects
- Predictive Model to dynamically adjust eviction decisions

3. Weighted Priority Scoring (WPS)
We'll assign a score to each cache item usinga weighted function of its recency (LRU), frequency (LFU) and a predicive score that estimates future usage. This help in deciding which entries to evict.

Implementation Outline:
1. Track Access Frequency (LFU) : We'll add a field to track how many times each key has been accessed. This will influence the eviction strategy.
2. Track Access Recency (LRU) : We'll use a Linked List to track the order in which cache entries are accessed.
3. Predictive Model: We'll design a lightweight heuristic (based on time-series patterns or access patterns) to predict the next likely access time.
